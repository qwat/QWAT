QWAT User Guide
===============

This represents a guide on how to collect data in QWAT (digitizing), edit existing data and use various tools.

The QGIS 2 documentation is available `here <https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/fr/docs/user_manual/>`_. The following QGIS plugins are useful tools for editing and working with QWAT data :

* `Link It <http://3nids.github.io/linkit/>`_ : provides the user an easy way to link objects in the map from the relations in the project.

* `Intersect It <http://3nids.github.io/intersectit/>`_ : provides the user to construct new points from intersection with other objects in the map.


At the open of the projet, a message appear. You must activate macro. Since QWAT have a lot of triggers and relations, some actions are generated with python in QGIS.
